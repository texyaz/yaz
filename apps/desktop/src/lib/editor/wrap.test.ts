/**
 * Long lines coming back round.
 *
 * A pasted URL or a long sentence otherwise runs off to the right and takes
 * the rest of the document with it: the horizontal scrollbar appears, every
 * other line becomes shorter than the pane, and reading means scrolling
 * sideways and back for one line in fifty.
 *
 * CodeMirror signals wrapping by putting `cm-lineWrapping` on the content
 * element, which is what these check — jsdom does no layout, so whether text
 * *visually* wraps is not a question that can be asked here. What can be asked
 * is whether the extension is in force, and whether switching it reconfigures
 * the view rather than rebuilding it.
