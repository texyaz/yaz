/**
 * The paper, in pixels.
 *
 * # Why this is not measured
 *
 * A sheet of A4 is 297 mm tall. That is not a fact about the font, the zoom, or
 * what has been scrolled into view — it is a fact about the paper — so it is
 * arithmetic and not a measurement. Everything here comes straight from the
 * page size the author chose and the magnification they are looking at.
 *
 * That matters because measuring it was a bug. The magnification is a CSS
 * custom property, and setting it does not resize anything until the browser
 * gets a turn; reading a line height straight afterwards paired the old height
 * with the new zoom. The page size never needed measuring, so it no longer is.
 *
 * What *does* need measuring is how tall the content turned out — and that is
 * [`pagination.ts`](./pagination.ts)'s business, where it belongs.
