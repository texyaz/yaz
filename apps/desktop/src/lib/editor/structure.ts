/**

 *
 * # Deliberately not a parser
 *
 * This scans for a fixed set of commands and matches their braces. It does not
 * build a syntax tree, expand macros or understand `\newcommand`, and it will
 * never be right about a document that redefines `\section`.
 *
 * That is the correct amount of machinery for what it feeds. An outline that
 * misses a heading in a pathological document is a mildly wrong list; the real
 * syntax tree arrives with the Lezer grammar in phase 4
 * ([ADR-0004](https://generalpawz.github.io/yaz/adr/0004-editor-core-codemirror-single-buffer)),
 * and these consumers will move onto it. Writing a half-parser now would be
 * building the thing that replaces itself.
