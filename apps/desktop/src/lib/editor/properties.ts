/**
 * The standardised things a document declares, read from and written to the
 * source.
 *
 * # Why this is a text transformation and not a data model
 *
 * The ribbon lets someone set the author without knowing that an author is
 * `\author{...}` in the preamble. That is the whole point of it. But there is
 * still one document and it is the `.tex` (ADR-0004), so "the author" is not a
 * field held beside the source that has to be kept in step — it is read out of
 * the source when asked and written back into it when changed.
 *
 * Which means a co-author who types `\author{}` by hand and a co-author who
 * uses the ribbon are editing the same thing, and neither can produce a
 * document where the two disagree.
 *
 * # Where things go
 *
 * A property that is already there is edited where it is. One that is not is
 * inserted in the place LaTeX expects it — package options in the
 * `\documentclass` line or a `\usepackage`, title-block commands in the
 * preamble just above `\begin{document}`. Appending everything to the end of
 * the preamble would work and would produce a preamble nobody wants to read.
