/**
 * Where a page begins, and how tall a page is.
 *
 * The second question used to be the hard one, and it is not a question any
 * more: a sheet is a fixed box painted behind the text, so it is exactly the
 * size of the paper whatever the content does. What is left to test is the two
 * things that can still be wrong — the instructions an author wrote about where
 * pages start, and the arithmetic that carries a block onto the next sheet.
 *
 * The measuring itself is not tested here. jsdom gives every element a height
 * of zero, so a test that drove the view would be measuring nothing and
 * agreeing with itself.
