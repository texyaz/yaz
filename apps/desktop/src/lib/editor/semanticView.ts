/**
 * Drawing what the commands mean.
 *
 * [`semantics.ts`](./semantics.ts) works out what each one stands for; this
 * puts it on screen. The split is the same one the rest of the editor keeps:
 * the arithmetic is a pure function over the text and is tested as one, and
 * only the drawing needs a browser.
 *
 * # Nothing here invents a number
 *
 * A `\ref` shows the number this editor counted, and a `\cite` shows what the
 * bibliography says. Where the document does not define the target — a label
 * that is not there, a key that is not in the `.bib` — the reference is drawn
 * as *unresolved* rather than as something plausible. A reference that looks
 * fine and points nowhere is the failure worth designing against: it survives
 * proofreading and shows up as `??` in the printed thesis.
