/**
 * Every keyboard shortcut yaz has, in one place.
 *
 * # Why a registry rather than keymaps where the features are
 *
 * A shortcut is not a property of the thing it does. It is a property of the
 * keyboard, and the keyboard is shared: two features that each seem entitled to
 * `Ctrl+B` cannot both have it, and neither can discover the conflict from
 * inside itself. Declaring them all here makes "what does this key do?" and
 * "what is bound twice?" answerable, which is also what makes them listable in
 * settings and rebindable at all.
 *
 * # Suites
 *
 * Each shortcut carries tags, and a tag can be switched off wholesale — the
 * Word-style bindings are the reason. Someone arriving from Word wants `Ctrl+B`
 * to embolden; someone arriving from Vim wants that key for something else and
 * would rather it did nothing than something surprising. Neither is talked out
 * of it, and the choice is one switch rather than fifteen.
 *
 * # Chords
 *
 * A binding may be a sequence: `Ctrl+Space R` means the modifier combination,
 * then the letter. Chords exist because the single-key space is full — every
 * `Ctrl+<letter>` is spoken for by the platform, the editor, or Word — and
 * because a prefix is how a person remembers a family of related commands
 * rather than fifteen unrelated ones.
