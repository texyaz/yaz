/**
 * What kind of text a file is, and what the editor can do about it.

 * # Every text file opens
 *
 * The editor is not a LaTeX editor that also happens to hold other files. A
 * project has a `.bib`, a `yaz.toml`, a CI workflow, a README — and until now
 * each of those opened as LaTeX, which is worse than opening as nothing:
 * `%` became a comment in a file where it is a per cent sign.
 *
 * So the floor is a plain text editor with line numbers, wrapping, Vim and
 * search, which works for any file at all. A format adds to that floor; it is
 * never what makes the file openable.
 *
 * # And the extra is a plugin, loaded when it is needed
 *
 * Each format's language is behind a dynamic import, so a session that never
 * opens a `.yaml` never loads the YAML mode. The registry holds the loaders
 * rather than the languages themselves, which is what keeps that true —
 * importing a language here to name it would load all of them at startup.
 *
 * Each can be switched off, and off means the plain text floor rather than
 * nothing: someone who finds a highlighter wrong about their file wants their
 * file, not an error.
