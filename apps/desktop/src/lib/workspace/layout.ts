/**
 * The pane layout: a tree of splits with tabs at the leaves.
 *
 * # Why a tree rather than a fixed two-column grid
 *
 * The shell started as editor-left, PDF-right, hard-coded. Every view added
 * after that — a rich-text mode, an outline, a diff — would have needed its own
 * slot and its own arrangement rule. A tree costs the same whether it holds two
 * panes or six, and "close the PDF and give the editor the whole window" stops
 * being a special case.
 *
 * # Everything here is a pure function
 *
 * Layout operations take a tree and return a new one, with no reference to the
 * DOM, to Svelte, or to what a tab actually renders. That is deliberate: the
 * fiddly parts of a docking layout are the tree edits — dropping a tab onto the
 * pane it already occupies, closing the last tab in a split, collapsing a split
 * with one child left — and those are exactly what is hard to check by clicking
 * around and easy to check here.
 *
 * @see {@link https://generalpawz.github.io/yaz/adr/0005-extensibility-tiers | ADR-0005}, which makes
 * pane layout a core responsibility rather than something a plugin owns.
