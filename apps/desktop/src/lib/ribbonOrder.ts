/**
 * What order the ribbon's tabs appear in.
 *
 * Start, then the tabs about the document, then Connections, View and Help.
 * That is close to Word's own order and it is not arbitrary: the first tab is
 * where a session begins, and the last few are set up once and then left
 * alone, which is not what the tabs between them are for.
 *
 * # Why this is sorted rather than arranged
 *
 * The tabs come from several places — the menus, and the ones the ribbon
 * declares itself — and they are concatenated. Arranging them by hand means
 * the order depends on where each source happens to be spliced in, so a tab
 * added later lands wherever its source sits rather than where it belongs.
 *
 * # Why it is its own file
 *
 * Because it is arithmetic, and arithmetic about positions is where an
 * off-by-one lives. Inside a component it could only be checked by looking at
 * the window; here it can be asked directly.
