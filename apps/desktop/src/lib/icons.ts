/**

 * Shared rather than copied, because the menus and the ribbon show the same
 * commands and a command has to look the same in both. Two copies of a path
 * means the day someone improves the save icon it improves in one of them, and
 * the difference is invisible until a user notices two save buttons that are
 * not the same shape.
 *
 * # Named ideas, not named pictures
 *
 * `folder` is "open", wherever opening happens. That is what makes a ribbon
 * scannable: the eye learns one mark and finds it again, rather than learning
 * a mark per menu entry.
 *
 * # Inline paths rather than an icon font
 *
 * A font is a network request, a licence and a flash of missing glyphs, for a
 * couple of dozen shapes that between them are smaller than the request would
 * have been.
