     * is why they cannot be found from here when the application compiles the
     * plugin's *source* into itself.
     *
     * The two are reconciled by saying so explicitly rather than by hoisting.
     * A plugin reaching for something not on this list fails to build here,
     * which is the same answer it would get from a user who installed it, and
     * the list is short enough to read.
