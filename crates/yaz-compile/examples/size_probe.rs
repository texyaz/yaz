//! Forces the embedded engine to be linked, so its contribution to a shipped
//! binary can be measured rather than guessed at.
//!
//! Tectonic statically links XeTeX, ICU4C, freetype2, graphite2, libpng and
//! zlib. That is a large amount of C, and "how much bigger does the application
//! get" is a fair question to ask before making it the default engine
//! ([ADR-0007]). A `cargo build` of the library alone does not answer it: rlibs
//! are not linked, and dead-code elimination only happens at link time.
//!
//! # Referencing the type is not enough
//!
//! The first version of this probe constructed a `TectonicEngine` and called
//! `id()` and `is_available()`. Both are trivial - one returns a literal, the
//! other returns `true` - and neither reaches a single line of Tectonic. The
//! linker duly discarded the engine, and the measurement reported **0 bytes
//! added on linux-aarch64**: a whole TeX engine costing nothing, which should
//! have been obviously impossible.
//!
//! To keep the engine, the binary has to contain a call that actually enters it.
//! The call below is guarded by a runtime condition the compiler cannot fold
//! away, so the code is retained without the probe ever typesetting anything.
//!
