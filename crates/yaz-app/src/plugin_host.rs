//! The brokered command surface plugins reach the system through.
//!
//! Every command here takes a `plugin_id`, looks up that plugin's
//! [`Broker`](yaz_plugin::Broker), and refuses before doing any work. There is
//! no unbrokered path: a command that skipped this would be the private back
//! door [ADR-0005] exists to forbid, and the Zotero bridge is a core plugin
//! precisely so that it has to live with the same API an external author gets.
//!
//! # What `plugin_id` does and does not prove
//!
//! It is supplied by the webview, so it identifies the *caller's claim*, not the
//! caller. Plugins share one JavaScript realm ([ADR-0006]), which means one
//! plugin can already read another's memory, overlay its interface, and — here —
//! name its id. **Capabilities therefore bound what the plugin layer as a whole
//! can do, not what one plugin can do relative to another.**
//!
//! A per-plugin token handed out at load would raise the bar slightly and would
//! not change that conclusion, because any plugin able to name another's id can
//! equally read its token out of the shared realm. Adding one would make the
//! boundary look stronger than it is, which is worse than stating the limit, so
//! this is stated rather than decorated. `SECURITY.md` says the same thing about
//! the DOM.
//!
//! What the broker does buy is real: a plugin cannot reach the filesystem
//! outside the granted roots, cannot reach an undeclared host, and cannot
//! execute an undeclared binary — regardless of what it claims to be.
