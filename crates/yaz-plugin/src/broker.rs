//! The capability broker — the enforcement point.
//!
//! Every privileged request from a plugin passes through [`Broker::authorise`].
//! There is no other path to the filesystem, the network, or a subprocess.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! These are the properties the broker must hold. Each has a corresponding
//! adversarial test, and a change here without one should not be merged.
//!
//! 1. **Canonicalise before deciding.** A path is fully resolved — `..`
//!    components collapsed, symlinks followed — *before* it is compared against
//!    any root. Checking the requested path rather than the resolved one is the
//!    classic traversal escape.
//! 2. **Hosts are matched, not logged.** A network request to an undeclared host
//!    is refused, not permitted-with-a-warning.
//! 3. **Deny by default.** An unrecognised or malformed request is refused.
//! 4. **Every denial is recorded** in a log the user can inspect, attributed to
//!    the requesting plugin.
//!
//! # Why canonicalising a path that does not exist is the hard case
//!
//! A plugin writing a *new* file names a path with nothing at the end of it, so
//! `canonicalize` fails outright. Resolving only the existing ancestor and
//! rejoining the rest is what makes the check work for writes — and getting that
//! wrong in the other direction, by skipping canonicalisation when the file is
//! absent, would leave a hole that opens the moment a plugin picks a name that
//! does not exist yet.
//!
