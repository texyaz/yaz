# Architecture Decision Records

Every decision that is expensive to reverse lives here. If a future contributor
would reasonably ask "why on earth is it done _this_ way", the answer belongs in
an ADR, not in a commit message and not in someone's head.

## Format

We use a trimmed [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) layout. Copy
[`template.md`](template.md) and give it the next free number.

## Status values

| Status               | Meaning                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Proposed`           | Written down, not yet agreed. Do not build on it.   |
| `Accepted`           | In force. Code is expected to comply.               |
| `Deprecated`         | Still true of the code, but we intend to change it. |
| `Superseded by NNNN` | No longer in force. Kept for the historical record. |

**ADRs are append-only.** We never delete or rewrite the reasoning of an accepted
ADR; we supersede it with a new one that explains what changed. The record of a
decision we later reversed is more valuable than a tidy directory.
