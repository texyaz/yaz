# Architecture decisions

Every decision that is expensive to reverse, and the reasoning behind it. These
are published rather than kept internal: a plugin author asking why the API is
shaped a particular way should be able to read the answer.

Records are append-only. A reversed decision is superseded by a new record
rather than edited, because the history of a decision we later changed is more
useful than a tidy directory.
