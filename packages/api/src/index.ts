/**
 * The public plugin API for yaz.
 *
 * # What this is
 *
 * Everything a plugin can do, and nothing else. Plugins run in the application's
 * webview with full DOM access — which is what lets them build real user
 * interfaces — but they have **no ambient authority**: `fetch`,
 * `XMLHttpRequest`, WebSocket and the raw IPC handle are removed before plugin
 * code runs. Privileged operations go through the methods here, and every one of
 * them is brokered by the Rust core against the capabilities the user granted.
 *
 * # Two rules that shape this file
 *
 * **No framework types.** The application shell is built with Svelte, and
 * nothing here exposes that. A plugin receives `HTMLElement`s and plain objects.
 * This is what allows the shell to be rebuilt on a different framework without
 * breaking a single plugin.
 *
 * **This is a promise.** Every export is semver-stable. A breaking change is a
 * major bump, without exception, because plugin authors depend on that being
 * trustworthy.
 *
 * @see {@link https://generalpawz.github.io/yaz/adr/0005-extensibility-tiers | ADR-0005}
